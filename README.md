## Context:
EMS professionals need to be prepared on arrival. 
When a patient calls in with a complaint, EMS need to interpret that complaint and prepare based on what they think the situation might be. 

Interpreting patient complaints can be tricky though. For example:  
  • a patient will call in with "breathing problems"  
  • EMS expect to bag/intubate/give inhalants  
  • turns out patient is having an anxiety attack  

## Project:
Our project aims to help EMS by providing easily-accessible information about the potential outcomes associated with any given patient complaint.  
If EMS can successfully assess the potential outcomes associated with a given complaint, they can be better prepared to deal with the situation when they arrive.


We plan to create a visualization of the probability space around these 3 stages of informmation:
  1) Initial Complaint 
  2) Provider Impression 
  3) Final Diagnosis
